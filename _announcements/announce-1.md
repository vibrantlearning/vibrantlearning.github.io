Hi everyone, a few announcements:
- Biology class has been cancelled because there weren't many sign-ups for the course. All other classes are still available/ongoing!
- The [calendar](https://tinyurl.com/occ-s5-info) is **outdated**. Please refer to the [Schedule](/schedule/) page instead.
- There _will_ be a 6th Contest Math class on **Friday, 8/5**. We won't be covering any material; instead, we'll be playing some math games like Countdown and 24!
