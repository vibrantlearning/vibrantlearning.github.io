Tommy is a high school senior who enjoys resorting to interesting hobbies such as tennis, magic, and designing banking tables that may never be used, but he did participate in competitions such as NSDA, USACO, Science Bowl, and King of the Hill Chess many moons ago. He now finds more interest teaching young and curious individuals a variety of engaging topics.
